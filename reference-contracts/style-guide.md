# Style Style

# Introduction

The purpose of this guide is to provide coding conventions for writing scilla code.

Please note that as Scilla is an evolving language, this style guide will change over time to reflect the latest usability feedback and features. This guide shall hence be thought of as an evolving document over time, instead of a commandment that is set in stone.

## General

Scilla belongs to the meta-language ("ML") family of languages, and therefore, the style shall be consistent with the principles laid out in ML-languagues.

Scilla is developed off the back of OCaml, therfore our guidelines are very similar to the ones laid out by the OCaml community. There are however, some variations that we have made intentionally to cater for the design and purpose of Scilla. For example, OCaml does not specify naming conventions for variables, but we hope that Scilla developers will follow the `snake_case` convention. This is because smart contract parameters are meant to be interoperable, and sticking to consistent cases can make it easier for people to read your code and send transactions to your contract if required.

In the event where you encounter something that is _not_ covered by this document, you can refer to [https://ocaml.org/learn/tutorials/guidelines.html](https://ocaml.org/learn/tutorials/guidelines.html)

# Code Layout

### **Indentation**

Use 2 spaces per indentation level.

### **Tabs or Spaces**

Spaces are the preferred indentation method.

### Blank lines

Surround the top of every procedure, library and transition with blank spaces

### Maximum Line Length

As recommended by [PEP 8](<[https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#maximum-line-length](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#maximum-line-length)>), we recommend that you keep lines in Scilla contracts to a maximum of 80 characters for readability.

Wrapped lines should conform to the following rules:

- The first argument should not be attached to the opening parenthesis
- One, and only one, indent should be used
- Each argument should fall on its own line
- The terminating element,Â );, should be placed on the final line by itself

```ocaml
(* Good *)
    transition MakeOrder(
    	token_a: ByStr20,
    	value_a: Uint128,
    	token_b: ByStr20,
    	value_b: Uint128,
    	expiration_block: BNum
    )

 (* Bad *)
 (* Reason: All the parameters are in the same line, which makes it hard to read *)
    transition MakeOrder(token_a: ByStr20, value_a: Uint128, token_b: ByStr20, value_b: Uint128, expiration_block: BNum)
```

## Indentation Rules

- Indentation for `let...in` expressions
- The expression following a definition introduced by `let` is indented to the same level as the keyword `let`, and the keyword `in` which introduces it is written at the end of the line.

```ocaml

    (* Code snippet from Shogi.scilla *)

    (* Good *)
    ...
    let nil_path = Nil {Square} in
    let first_square = move_one_square square north in
    let final_square = move_one_square first_square direction in
    Cons {Square} final_square nil_path

    (* Bad *)
    ...
    let nil_path = Nil {Square} in
      let first_square = move_one_square square north in
        let final_square = move_one_square first_square direction in
          Cons {Square} final_square nil_path
```

## Naming Conventions

Definition of the various styles:

- `PascalCase`
- `camelCase`
- `snake_case`
- `lowercase`
- `UPPER_CASE`
- `Camel_snake`

> **NOTE:** Naming variables with a leading underscore is not allowed in Scilla (e.g. `_to`)

### Contract and Library Names

- Library and Contracts should be named in PascalCase. E.g. `FungibleToken`, `NonFungibleToken`
- Contract and Library name should match the filename

```ocaml

(* Good *)
(* NonFungibleToken.scilla *)
library NonFungibleToken

contract NonFungibleToken
(
  param1: type,
  ...
)

(* Bad *)
(* nonfungibletoken-finalfinalfinal.scilla *)
library NonFungibleToken

contract NonFungibleToken
(
  param1: type,
  ...
)
```

### Event Names

- Event names should be named in PascalCase. E.g. `TransferFromSuccess`
- Please note that `scilla-checker` checks for the parameters as well. Overloading an event name is not allowed
- Event name should be concise and contained within a single word

```ocaml
(* Good *)
e = {_eventname: "TransferFromSuccess"; status: "Success" sender: _sender; ...};
e = {_eventname: "TransferFromFailure"; status: "Error";  message: "Unauthorised; ...};

(* Bad *)
e = {_eventname: "TransferFrom Not Successful"}
e = {_eventname: "TransferFrom: Success"}
```

### Transition Name

- TransitionName should be named in PascalCase
- E.g. `TransferFrom`

### Abstract Data Types (ADT)

- ADT names should be in PascalCase

> **NOTE:** The checker currently checks if the error is capitalised, but it does not check for PascalCase

Example:

```ocaml
(* Good *)
type Error =
| GameOver
| PlayingOutOfTurn
| IllegalAction
| InternalError

(* Bad *)
type Error =
| Gameover
| Playingoutofturn
| Illegalsction
| Internalerror

(* Bad (Syntax Error as error types are not capitalised) *)
type Error =
| gameover
| playingoutofturn
| illegalsction
| internalerror


```

### Local Variable Names

- To be consistent with OCaml styling guidelines, variable names should be named in snake_case. Variable names with only one word should be in lowercase E.g. `one_msg`,`transfer_amt`, `zero`, `player1`

```ocaml
(* Good *)
let code_success = Uint32 0

(* Bad *)
let codeSuccess = Uint32 0
let CodeSuccess = Uint32 0
let Code_success = Uint32 0
```
