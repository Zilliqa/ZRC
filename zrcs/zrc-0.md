## What is a ZRC?

ZRC stands for Zilliqa Reference Contracts. A ZRC is a design document meant for the [Zilliqa](https://www.zilliqa.com) community that lays down application-level standards and conventions for contracts, tokens and libraries. The target language for the contracts and libraries is expected to be [Scilla](https://scilla.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). The ZRC should provide a concise technical specification of the contract's purpose and the features that it should provide. The ZRC author is responsible for building consensus within the community and documenting dissenting opinions.

## ZRC Rationale

We intend ZRCs to be the primary mechanisms for proposing new template reusable contracts and libraries, for collecting community technical input, and for documenting the design decisions that went into the proposal. Because the ZRCs are maintained as text files in a versioned repository, their revision history is the historical record of the proposal.

For implementers, ZRCs are a convenient way to track the progress of their implementation. Ideally each implementation maintainer would list the ZRCs that they have implemented. This will give end users a convenient way to know the current status of a given implementation.

It is highly recommended that a single ZRC contain a single key contract or library standard and it should present a proposal that defines a standard for multiple apps to use.

A ZRC must meet certain minimum criteria. It must be a clear and complete description of the proposed smart contract or library standard. The proposed implementation, if applicable, must be solid and complete. Since the target language of the proposed contract and library will be Scilla, the proposal must use Scilla as the description language.

## ZRC Work Flow

### Shepherding a ZRC

Parties involved in the process are you, the champion or _ZRC author_, the [_ZRC editors_](#zrc-editors), and the [_Zilliqa Core Developers_](https://github.com/orgs/Zilliqa/people).

Before you begin writing a formal ZRC, you should vet your idea. Ask the Zilliqa community first if an idea is original to avoid wasting time on something that will be be rejected based on prior research. It is thus recommended to use one of the groups on the [Zilliqa Discord Channel](https://discord.gg/mWp9HdR), or [the Issues section of this repository](https://github.com/Zilliqa/ZRC/issues).

In addition to making sure your idea is original, it will be your role as the author to make your idea clear to reviewers and interested parties, as well as inviting editors, developers and community to give feedback on the aforementioned channels. You should try and gauge whether the interest in your ZRC is commensurate with both the work involved in implementing it and how many parties will have to conform to it. Negative community feedback will be taken into consideration and may prevent your ZRC from moving past the Draft stage.

_In short, your role as the champion is to write the ZRC using the style and format described below, shepherd the discussions in the appropriate forums, and build community consensus around the idea._

### ZRC Process

Following is the process that a successful ZRC will move along:

```
[ DRAFT ] -> [ READY ] -> [ APPROVED ] -> [ IMPLEMENTED ]
```

Each status change is requested by the ZRC author and reviewed by the ZRC editors. Use a pull request to update the status. Please include a link to where people should continue discussing your ZRC. The ZRC editors will process these requests as per the conditions below.

- **DRAFT** -- Once the champion has asked the Zilliqa community whether an idea has any chance of support, they will write a draft ZRC as a pull request. Consider including an implementation if this will aid people in studying the ZRC. A draft is a preliminary version of the ZRC that is not yet ready for final submission. Once the first draft has been merged, you may submit follow-up pull requests with further changes to your draft until such point as you believe the ZRC to be mature and ready to proceed to the next status.
  - :arrow_right: Ready -- If agreeable, ZRC editor will assign the ZRC a number (generally the issue or PR number related to the ZRC) and merge your pull request. The ZRC editor will not unreasonably deny a ZRC .
  - :x: Ready -- Reasons for denying ready status include being too unfocused, too broad, duplication of effort, being technically unsound, not providing proper motivation or addressing backwards compatibility, etc.
- **READY** -- This status means that the ZRC is ready for review by a wide audience. At this stage, the contract standard must accompany an implementation.
  - :arrow_right: Approved -- If agreeable, the ZRC editor will assign Approved and set a review end date usually two weeks.
  - :x: Approved -- A request for Approved will be denied if material changes are still expected to be made to the draft.
- **APPROVED** -- It signals a finalized version of the ZRC that has been in the Ready state for at least 2 weeks and any technical changes that were requested have been addressed by the author.

  - :x: Implemented which results in material changes or substantial unaddressed technical complaints will cause the ZRC to revert to Draft.
  - :arrow_right: Implemented -- a finalized version of the ZRC that the Core Devs have decided to implement and release.

- **IMPLEMENTED** -- This ZRC represents the current state-of-the-art. An Implemented ZRC should only be updated to correct errata.

## What belongs in a successful ZRC?

Each ZRC should have the following parts:

- Preamble - RFC 822 style headers containing metadata about the ZRC, including the ZRC number, a short descriptive title (limited to a maximum of 44 characters), and the author details.
- Abstract - A short (~200 word) description of the technical issue (contract or library standard) being addressed.
- Motivation (\*optional) - It should clearly explain why the proposal is important. ZRC submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.
- Specification - The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of the contract and its various components. The specification should be detailed enough to allow competing, interoperable implementations.
- Rationale - The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work, e.g. how the feature is supported in other languages. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.
- Backwards Compatibility - All ZRCs that introduce backwards incompatibilities must include a section describing these incompatibilities and their severity. The ZRC must explain how the author proposes to deal with these incompatibilities. ZRC submissions without a sufficient backwards compatibility treatise may be rejected outright.
- Test Cases - Test cases for an implementation are mandatory.
- Implementations - The implementations must be completed before any ZRC is given status “READY”, but it need not be completed before the ZRC is merged as draft. While there is merit to the approach of reaching consensus on the specification and rationale before writing code, the principle of “rough consensus and running code” is still useful when it comes to resolving many discussions of specification details.
- Copyright Waiver - All ZRCs must be in the public domain. See the bottom of this ZRC for an example copyright waiver.

## ZRC Formats and Templates

ZRCs should be written in [markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) format.
Image files should be included in a subdirectory of the `assets` folder for that ZRC as follows: `assets/zrc-N` (where **N** is to be replaced with the ZRC number). When linking to an image in the ZRC, use relative links such as `../assets/zrc-1/image.png`.

## ZRC Header Preamble

Each ZRC must begin with an [RFC 822](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc822.txt) style header preamble, preceded and followed by three hyphens (`---`). This header is also termed ["front matter" by Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/). The headers must appear in the following order. Headers marked with "\*" are optional and are described below. All other headers are required.

` zrc:` _ZRC number_ (this is determined by the ZRC editor)

` title:` _ZRC title_

` author:` _a list of the author's or authors' name(s) and/or username(s), or name(s) and email(s)._

` * discussions-to:` _a url pointing to the official discussion thread_

` status:` _Draft | Ready | Approved | Implemented_

`* review-period-end:` _date review period ends_

` type:` _Standard | Meta_

` created:` _date created on_

` * updated:` _comma separated list of dates_

` * requires:` _ZRC number(s)_

` * replaces:` _ZRC number(s)_

` * superseded-by:` _ZRC number(s)_

` * resolution:` _a url pointing to the resolution of this ZRC_

Headers that permit lists must separate elements with commas.

Headers requiring dates will always do so in the format of ISO 8601 (yyyy-mm-dd).

#### `author` header

The `author` header optionally lists the names, email addresses or usernames of the authors/owners of the ZRC. Those who prefer anonymity may use a username only, or a first name and a username. The format of the author header value must be:

> Random J. User &lt;address@dom.ain&gt;

or

> Random J. User (@username)

if the email address or GitHub username is included, and

> Random J. User

if the email address is not given.

#### `resolution` header

The `resolution` header can be used to point to a URL where the pronouncement about the ZRC is made.

#### `discussions-to` header

While a ZRC is a draft, a `discussions-to` header will indicate the mailing list or URL where the ZRC is being discussed. As mentioned above, examples for places to discuss your ZRC include [Zilliqa Discord Channel](https://discord.gg/mWp9HdR), an issue in this repo or in a fork of this repo.

No `discussions-to` header is necessary if the ZRC is being discussed privately with the author.

As a single exception, `discussions-to` cannot point to GitHub pull requests.

#### `type` header

The `type` header specifies the type of ZRC: Standards Track or Meta.

#### `created` header

The `created` header records the date that the ZRC was assigned a number. Both headers should be in yyyy-mm-dd format, e.g. 2001-08-14.

#### `updated` header

The `updated` header records the date(s) when the ZIP was updated with "substantial" changes.

#### `requires` header

ZRCs may have a `requires` header, indicating the ZRC numbers that this ZRC depends on.

#### `superseded-by` and `replaces` headers

ZRCs may also have a `superseded-by` header indicating that a ZRC has been rendered obsolete by a later document; the value is the number of the ZRC that replaces the current document. The newer ZRC must have a `replaces` header containing the number of the ZRC that it rendered obsolete.

## Auxiliary Files

ZRCs may include auxiliary files such as diagrams. Such files must be named ZRC-XXXX-Y.ext, where “XXXX” is the ZRC number, “Y” is a serial number (starting at 1), and “ext” is replaced by the actual file extension (e.g. “png”).

## Transferring ZRC Ownership

It occasionally becomes necessary to transfer ownership of ZRCs to a new champion. In general, we'd like to retain the original author as a co-author of the transferred ZRC, but that's really up to the original author. A good reason to transfer ownership is because the original author no longer has the time or interest in updating it or following through with the ZRC process, or has fallen off the face of the 'net (i.e. is unreachable or isn't responding to email). A bad reason to transfer ownership is because you don't agree with the direction of the ZRC. We try to build consensus around a ZRC, but if that's not possible, you can always submit a competing ZRC.

If you are interested in assuming ownership of a ZRC, send a message asking to take over, addressed to both the original author and the ZRC editor. If the original author doesn't respond to email in a timely manner, the ZRC editor will make a unilateral decision (it's not like such decisions can't be reversed :)).

## ZRC Editor Responsibilities

For each new ZRC that comes in, an editor does the following:

- Read the ZIP to check if it is ready: sound and complete. The ideas must make technical sense, even if they don't seem likely to get to final status.
- The title should accurately describe the content.
- Check the ZRC for language (spelling, grammar, sentence structure, etc.), markup (GitHub Flavored Markdown), code style

If the ZRC isn't ready, the editor will send it back to the author for revision, with specific instructions.

Once the ZRC is ready for the repository, the ZRC editor will:

- Assign a ZRC number (generally the PR number or, if preferred by the author, the Issue # if there was discussion in the Issues section of this repository about this ZRC)

- Merge the corresponding pull request

- Send a message back to the ZRC author with the next step.

Many ZRCs are written and maintained by developers with write access to the Zilliqa codebase. The ZRC editors monitor ZRC changes, and correct any structure, grammar, spelling, or markup mistakes we see.

The editors don't pass judgment on ZRCs. We merely do the administrative & editorial part.

## History

This document was derived heavily from [Ethereum's EIP-1](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-1.md) which in turn was derived from [Bitcoin's BIP-0001](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0001.mediawiki) written by Amir Taaki which in turn was derived from [Python's PEP-0001](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0001/). In many places text was simply copied and modified. Although the PEP-0001 text was written by Barry Warsaw, Jeremy Hylton, and David Goodger, they are not responsible for its use in the Zilliqa Reference Contracts, and should not be bothered with technical questions specific to Zilliqa or the ZRC. Please direct all comments to the ZRC editors.
