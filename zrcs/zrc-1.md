## I. What are Non Fungible Tokens?

An NFT, or Non Fungible Token is an open standard to create collectible assets. Unlike fungible tokens, each token is completely unique and non-interchangeable with other tokens.

## II. Abstract 

ZRC-1 defines a minimum interface a smart contract must implement to allow unique tokens to be managed, tracked, owned, and traded. 


## III. Motivation

A standard for NFT can serve as an interface for game creators to create kitties, cards or weapons; by institutions to create certifications, diplomas and identifications. Generally, NFTs can be used to represent unique and rare assets as tokens.

## IV. Specification

The NFT contract specification as described below: 
1) the global error codes to be declared in the library part of the contract. 
2) the names and types of the mutable variables (aka `fields`). 
3) the transitions that will allow changing the values of the mutable variables. 
4) the events to be emitted by them.

### A. Error Codes

The NFT contract must define the following global constants in the library part of the contract code. These constants will be used as error codes in events.

| Name | Type | Code | Description
|--|--|--|--|
| `code_success` | `Uint32` | `0` | Emit when the transition call is successful. 
| `code_failure` | `Uint32` | `1` | Emit when the transition call is unsuccessful. 
| `code_not_authorized` | `Uint32` | `2` | Emit when the transition call is unauthorized for a given user. 

### B. Fields

| Name | Type | Description
|--|--|--|
| `tokenOwnerMap` | `Map Uint256 ByStr20 = Emp Uint256 ByStr20` | Mapping between tokenId to token owner. |
| `ownedTokenCount` | `Map ByStr20 Uint256 = Emp ByStr20 Uint256` | Mapping from owner to number of owned tokens. |
| `tokenApprovals` | `Map Uint256 ByStr20 = Emp Uint256 ByStr20` | Mapping between tokenId to approved address. Token owner can approve an address to transfer a particular token (given a tokenId) to other addresses. |
| `operatorApprovals` | `Map ByStr20 (Map ByStr20 Bool) = Emp ByStr20 (Map ByStr20 Bool)` | Mapping from owner to operator approvals. |

### C. Transitions

**1. Approve()**

```ocaml
(* Approves an address to transfer the given token ID *)
transition approve(to: ByStr20, tokenId: Uint256)
```

|  | Name | Type| Description
|--|--|--|--|
| @param | `to` | `ByStr20` | Address to be approved for the given token id. |
| @param | `tokenId` | `Uint256` | Id of the token to be approved. |

|  | Name | Description | Event Parameters
|--|--|--|--|
| eventName | `ApproveSuccess` | emit event if the call is successful. | `from`: `ByStr20`, `approvedTo`: `ByStr20`, `token`: `Uint256` |
| eventName | `ApproveFailure` | emit event if the call is unsuccessful. | `code`: `code_failure` or `code_not_authorized` |

<br/>

**2. ApprovalForAll()**

```ocaml
(* Sets or unsets the approval of a given operator *)
transition setApprovalForAll(to: ByStr20, approved: Bool)
```

|  | Name | Type| Description
|--|--|--|--|
| @param | `to` | `ByStr20` | Address to be set or unset as operator. |
| @param | `approved` | `Bool` | Status of the approval to be set. |

|  | Name | Description | Event Parameters
|--|--|--|--|
| eventName | `SetApprovalForAllSuccess` | emit event if the call is successful. | `from`: `ByStr20`, `recipient`: `ByStr20`, `status`: `Bool` |
| eventName | `SetApprovalForAllFailure` | emit event if the call is unsuccessful. | `code`: `code_failure` or `code_not_authorized` |

<br/>

**3. TransferFrom()**

```ocaml
(* Transfer the ownership of a given token ID to another address *)
transition transferFrom(from: ByStr20, to: ByStr20, tokenId: Uint256)
```

|  | Name | Type| Description
|--|--|--|--|
| @param | `from` | `ByStr20` | Current owner of the token. |
| @param | `to` | `ByStr20` | Recipient address of the token. |
| @param | `tokenId` | `Uint256` | Id of the token to be transferred. |

|  | Name | Description | Event Parameters
|--|--|--|--|
| eventName | `TransferSuccess` | emit event if the call is successful. | `from`: `ByStr20`, `recipient`: `ByStr20`, `token`:  `Uint256` |
| eventName | `TransferFailure` | emit event if the call is unsuccessful. | `code`: `code_failure` or `code_not_authorized` |

<br/>

**4. BalanceOf()**

```ocaml
(* Count the number of NFTs assigned to an owner *)
transition balanceOf(address: ByStr20)
```

|  | Name | Type| Description
|--|--|--|--|
| @param | `address` | `ByStr20` | Address of an owner. |

|  | Name | Description | Event Parameters
|--|--|--|--|
| eventName | `BalanceOfSuccess` | emit event if the call is successful. | `bal`:  `Uint128` |
| eventName | `BalanceOfFailure` | emit event if the call is unsuccessful. | `code`: `code_failure` or `code_not_authorized` |

<br/>

**5. TransferSingle()**

```ocaml
(* Mint or Burn tokens *)
transition transferSingle(operator: ByStr20, from: ByStr20, to: ByStr20, tokenId: String, value: Uint128)
```

|  | Name | Type| Description
|--|--|--|--|
| @param | `operator` | `ByStr20` | Address of an account that is approved to make the transfer. Token owners can assign other people to be an operator of their token. Once assigned, the operators can make any transfer for the token owner on his behalf. `operatorApprovals` store the mapping between the owner to the operators that he has approved. |
| @param | `from` | `ByStr20` | Address of the holder whose balance is decreased. |
| @param | `to` | `ByStr20` | Address of the recipient whose balance is increased. |
| @param | `tokenId` | `Uint256` | Token id of the new token. |
| @param | `value` | `Uint128` | Number of tokens the holder balance is decreased by and match what the recipient balance is increased by. |

|  | Name | Description | Event Parameters
|--|--|--|--|
| eventName | `TransferSingleSuccess` | emit event if the call is successful. | `by`: `ByStr20`, `recipient`: `ByStr20`, `token`: `Uint256` |
| eventName | `TransferSingleFailure` | emit event if the call is unsuccessful. | `code`: `code_failure` or `code_not_authorized` |
