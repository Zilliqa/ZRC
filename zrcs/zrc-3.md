## I. What are Metatransactions?

[The concept of metatransactions](https://medium.com/builders-of-zilliqa/zrc3s-grand-rewrite-22558797ea0) is intended to allow wallets to sign incomplete transactions that represent the authorization to spend a certain amount of tokens. These are valuable to users who do not wish to go through KYC, etc to get a trivial amount of ZIL in order to pay for a transaction. Developers may choose to include this pattern to give an easier onboarding UX, or also to enable transactions to be paid for in the native token. This standard includes an example of ZRC-2 integrated with metatransactions, but there are many situations where authorizing an effect via a signed message is valuable. The drawback is a metatransaction cannot easily be cancelled, so signers of metatransactions should view them as transactions that have already been processed, and if the relayer censors them they should re-send the same exact metatransaction to another relayer to void the original censored transaction.

## II. Abstract

ZRC-3 defines a basic supplement to another contract with the ability to perform transitions with metatransactions. In this provided standard we build on ZRC-2 to enable metatransaction transfers.

## III. Motivation

Metatransactions provide an alternative flow for users just getting started with their cryptocurrency and wallets. It allows for gasless transactions, cutting out the barrier of getting ZIL from an exchange or via mining before a Dapp user can interact with the smart contract.
It can also be seen as a way to defer the processing of transactions or even to guard a transition that requires multiparty authorization, although those applications are left to implementations and future standards. This contract adds a `metatransfer` transition to the existing ZRC-2. It does this in a way that maintains compatibility with the Operator and Mintable variants of ZRC-2 as well as the Zilswap exchange, and hopefully future OpFi tools.

## IV. Specification

The fungible token contract specification describes:

1. the global error codes to be declared in the library part of the contract;
2. the names and types of the immutable and mutable variables (aka `fields`);
3. the transitions that will allow the changing of values of the mutable variables;
4. the events to be emitted by them.

### A. Roles

## V. Existing Implementation(s)

- [ZRC3 Reference contract](../reference-contracts/MetaFungibleToken.scilla)
- [ZRC3 Reference Relayer ](https://github.com/starling-foundries/relay.js)
  To test the reference contract, simply go to the [`example`](../example) folder and run one of the JS scripts. For example, to deploy the contract, run:

```shell
yarn deploy.js
```

> **NOTE:** Please change the `privkey` in the script to your own private key. You can generate a testnet wallet and request for testnet \$ZIL at the [Nucleus Faucet](https://dev-wallet.zilliqa.com/home).
